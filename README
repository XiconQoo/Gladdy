DON'T MOVE OR RENAME THE REPO as it is referenced in the addon itself

Gladdy - the most powerful arena addon for WoW 2.4.3

https://github.com/SunstriderEmu/GladdyEndless/releases

Based on https://github.com/Schaka/gladdy

What is changed:

- Removed TrinketTracker module that guessed when PvP trinket was used. Now using a server message to reliably show trinket usage.
- Updates the "seconds until game starts" if the start time changes (a ready button has been clicked and the game starts earlier).
- Added a version check (upon receiving a message from the server)
