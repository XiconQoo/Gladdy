### Origin

Based on https://github.com/Schaka/gladdy

### Motivation for this edit

The goal is to make Gladdy highly configurable in it's appearance. Everything can be arranged left or right independently. Also we gave Gladdy a new look with black borders. A lot can be configured. Take a look at the [Changelist](https://github.com/XiconQoo/Gladdy#changes).

The PlateCastBar and TotemPlates module are completely reworked as well. Both are fully configurable and most importantly compatible with **Blizz, 
Aloft, ShaguPlates, SoHighPlates, ElvUI and Plates (by by siggestardust) !**
